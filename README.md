## 🔥 Featured Projects
### 🧠 U-Net based Satellite Image Enhancer
- Developed a deep **U-Net model** with skip connections and attention layers  
- Enhanced satellite terrain features with high **contextual accuracy** across patch boundaries
  
### 📄 Research Paper Pipeline Project  
- Developed and documented a complete **planetary image enhancement pipeline** as part of a research paper during ISRO internship
- We have evaluated our proposed methods using Indian Mars Colour Camera (MCC) images and compared with other state of the art image enhancement techniques. It involves Adaptive Gamma Correction (AGC) to correct brightness, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to locally enhance contrast, noise removal via median filtering, sharpening fine details through unsharp masking, and edge-preserving smoothing by bilateral filtering. In addition, we assess the improved performance of Mars Colour
- Demonstrated results on Martian terrain with **quantitative and visual comparisons**
  
### 🌌 Mars Image Enhancement using GANs
- Designed a **Pix2Pix GAN** to enhance Martian surface images with reflection padding and Gaussian feather stitching  
- Improved **perceptual quality** without introducing boundary artifacts  
- Evaluated using **BRISQUE**, **NIQE**, and **entropy** metrics  

### 🛰️ Planetary Patch Processing Framework
- Created a **patch-level deep learning pipeline** for large planetary images  
- Implemented **seamless stitching**, **patch line removal**, and **adaptive enhancement strategies**  

### 🧬 ResNet-based Enhancement Model  
- Implemented a **ResNet-based enhancement network** for improving fine surface details in planetary imagery  
- Compared performance with U-Net and GAN pipelines for various patch sizes  
- Integrated **reflection padding** and evaluated using **no-reference IQA metrics**  
- Achieved superior enhancement in low-texture crater regions and edge fidelity

### 🎯 Vision-AI in 5 Days – CIFAR-10
